# Where are *.js files?

We don't ship the .js files in the git master branch.
They are only present in version tags and in npm.

See how to get the JS files [here](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster#using-the-plugin) 
Or [how to build them](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster#building-testing-and-linting-scripts)
